# ALY6140_Analytics-Systems-Technology

In this course I strengthened my ability to work with real-world data by developing practical skills in data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, modeling, and communication. Throughout the course, I learned how to move from raw, unstructured datasets into well-organized, analysis-ready data pipelines using Python, SQL, and industry-standard libraries. I explored a range of tasks including data documentation, modular Python scripting, importing diverse file types, performing exploratory data analysis, and applying both descriptive and predictive modeling techniques. Each module focused on building a deeper understanding of how data flows through an analytical lifecycle and how to structure work in a way that is transparent, reproducible, and aligned with best practices.

The capstone experience tied everything together through a comprehensive, end-to-end analytical project where I applied statistical modeling, geospatial analysis, and effective data storytelling. I gained hands-on experience converting complex datasets into actionable insights, building multiple predictive models, and communicating results through written analysis and presentation. By the end of the course, I developed a strong understanding of how to combine technical data processing skills with clear narrative communication to produce meaningful, decision-ready insights—an essential capability for real analytics work in any industry.
