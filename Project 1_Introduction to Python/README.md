In this project, I completed the Week 1 assignment for ALY6060, focusing on the fundamentals of Python programming and its application in data science. I installed and set up a complete Python environment, including Jupyter Notebooks and essential libraries such as pandas and numpy. The assignment required me to implement several Python functions, work with loops and conditionals, and practice basic data structures while adhering to proper coding practices, such as using return statements instead of print statements when appropriate.

Throughout the project, I developed functions for mathematical operations like computing sums of squares and minimum square roots, formatted strings using Python f-strings to display personal information, iterated over sequences with while loops to identify specific numbers, and created a simple length conversion function from meters to miles. Completing this assignment strengthened my understanding of Python syntax, object-oriented principles, and the use of programming for real-world analytics tasks, laying the foundation for more advanced data science projects in the course.
