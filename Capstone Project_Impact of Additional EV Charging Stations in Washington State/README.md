For my ALY 6140 Capstone Project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) ownership in the state of Washington to determine where new charging stations should be added. I explored a large statewide EV registration dataset and began by cleaning, structuring, and examining the data using descriptive statistics, geographic assessments, and visual exploration. My goal was to understand the demographic and geographic distribution of EV owners, the makes and models they drive, and how far each vehicle can travel on a charge. I also incorporated variables such as legislative districts and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility to uncover the factors that most directly influence infrastructure needs.

I then advanced the analysis using predictive modeling techniques, including a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), to identify which vehicle attributes most strongly affected electric range. I paired this with geospatial mapping to highlight regional disparities in EV adoption and pinpoint locations where charging demand is likely to grow. By synthesizing descriptive insights, geospatial patterns, and predictive outputs, I developed recommendations for strategically expanding Washington’s EV charging infrastructure. This project reflects my ability to turn raw data into a coherent data story—combining analytics, visualization, and modeling to support data-driven decision-making.
