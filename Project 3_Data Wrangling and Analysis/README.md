In this project, I strengthened my foundational skills with NumPy and pandas by completing a series of mini data analyses designed to reinforce how these libraries store, manipulate, and extract insights from structured data. Working in a Jupyter notebook, I used NumPy to construct and analyze n-dimensional arrays, determine array properties, perform mathematical operations, and create transformed versions of existing arrays. These exercises helped me deepen my understanding of array shapes, dimensionality, broadcasting behavior, and vectorized operations—core concepts for efficient computational work in data science.

I then applied pandas to explore and analyze a real-world dataset containing U.S. airport traffic from February 2011. I practiced selecting subsets of data, querying and grouping with conditions, computing aggregated metrics, and answering quantitative questions about airport activity, state-level totals, and city-level comparisons. Completing this project helped me translate conceptual knowledge of pandas objects (Series and DataFrames) into practical analytical workflows, enabling me to extract meaningful insights through grouping, filtering, and summarizing operations. Overall, this assignment strengthened my confidence in using NumPy and pandas as essential tools for data manipulation and statistical analysis.
