In this project, I developed a Python script that demonstrates my ability to write well-documented, modular functions for importing multiple types of data files. I created separate functions to read CSV, text, JSON, and Excel files, ensuring that each function properly loads the data into an appropriate Python data structure, such as a pandas DataFrame or a dictionary, and returns it for further use. I followed best practices for Python programming by including clear docstrings, assigning proper function arguments, and using the if __name__ == "__main__": clause to structure the script for execution.

This assignment helped me deepen my understanding of Python’s data ingestion capabilities and how to handle different file types commonly used in data analytics projects. By building a reusable and well-documented script, I reinforced my skills in modular programming and data handling, which are essential for more advanced tasks in my Capstone Project and for real-world data analysis workflows.
