    "Module 2 Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview and Rationale\r\n",
    "The Week 2 Assignment requires you to write a python script that contains a function to import each of the example file types--a total of 4 functions. Being able to write a python script is a necessary skill for this course. In your Capstone Project you will be required to submit files that document your script. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Instructions\r\n",
    "The Python script should follow the format of the Template.py example. Specifically, for each of the example files (csv, text, json, and excel) write a separate function for each file type that, when given the file as an argument, imports the data from that file (that is, reads the file in) and assigns it to an appropriate Python data structure (like a data frame, etc) and returns that data structure. When you are done with the assignment, your script, when run, should call all these functions and, as a result, import all of the example files into corresponding Python data structures. Make sure that your function returns a data structure (such as a data frame and NOT a print statement).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Please make sure to:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Properly document the functions\r\n",
    "Properly assign arguments to the functions\r\n",
    "If you are using any libraries such as pandas or numpy, make sure that when you call the functions from these libraries you use all relevant arguments--for example, you should not just use pd.read_csv('file.csv'), but rather all necessary arguments of that function\r\n",
    "Avoid excessive printing\r\n",
    "Ensure that, as the requirement states above, import each file type's content into a corresponding Python data structure\r\n",
    "Utilize the if __name__ == '__main__': clause appropriately submit a proper Python script (.py file) as your one and only answer to the assignment\r\n",
    "Submit a proper Python script (.py file) as your one and only answer to the assignment"
