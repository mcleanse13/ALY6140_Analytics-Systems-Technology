In this project, I applied core principles of effective information design—grounded in the work of Edward Tufte—to explore Walmart store opening patterns from 1962 to 2006. Using Python’s primary visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, and bokeh), I created a series of analytical functions and visualizations that uncover trends in store expansion across U.S. states and cities. I began by cleaning and importing the dataset, calculating aggregated summaries, and answering targeted analytical questions, such as identifying states and cities with the highest concentration of Walmart locations.

I then developed custom visualization functions to communicate these findings, including time-series plots that show cumulative store growth over time and comparative bar charts for states surrounding Utah. This assignment strengthened my ability to combine data wrangling with clear, intuitive visual storytelling, demonstrating how well-designed visualizations can reveal meaningful patterns and insights in large datasets.
